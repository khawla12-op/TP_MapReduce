# MapReduce WordCount Example



## MapReduce Framework
MapReduce is a programming model and associated implementation for processing and generating large datasets in parallel across a distributed cluster. It consists of two main components:

1. **Mappers:** Programs responsible for extracting and transforming input data into key/value pairs.
2. **Reducers:** Programs that aggregate and process key/value pairs produced by the mappers.

## WordCount Example
The WordCount example is a classic MapReduce application used to count the frequency of words in a given text file. It consists of two main steps:

1. **Mapping:** The text is split into individual words, and each word is emitted as a key-value pair, where the word is the key and the value is 1.
2. **Reducing:** The output from the mapping phase is sorted and aggregated by unique words. The reducer then sums up the values associated with each word to determine the total count of occurrences.
